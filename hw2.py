def svm_solver(x_train, y_train, lr, num_iters,

    '''
    Computes an SVM given a training set, training labels, the number of
    iterations to perform projected gradient descent, a kernel, and a trade-off
    parameter for soft-margin SVM.

    Arguments:
        x_train: 2d tensor with shape (n, d).
        y_train: 1d tensor with shape (n,), whose elements are +1 or -1.
        lr: The learning rate.
        num_iters: The number of gradient descent steps.
        kernel: The kernel function.
           The default kernel function is 1 + <x, y>.
        c: The trade-off parameter in soft-margin SVM.
           The default value is None, referring to the basic, hard-margin SVM.

    Returns:
        alpha: a 1d tensor with shape (n,), denoting an optimal dual solution.
               Initialize alpha to be 0. NOTE: You should return alpha.detach()
               to speed up computations involving alpha down the line.

    Note that if you use something like alpha = alpha.clamp(...) with
    torch.no_grad(), you will have alpha.requires_grad=False after this step.
    You will then need to use alpha.requires_grad_().
    Alternatively, use in-place operations such as clamp_().

    '''
    Returns the kernel SVM's predictions for x_test using the SVM trained on
    x_train, y_train with computed dual variables alpha.

    Arguments:
        alpha: 1d tensor with shape (n,), denoting an optimal dual solution.
        x_train: 2d tensor with shape (n, d), denoting the training set.
        y_train: 1d tensor with shape (n,), whose elements are +1 or -1.
        x_test: 2d tensor with shape (m, d), denoting the test set.
        kernel: The kernel function.
           The default kernel function is 1 + <x, y>.

    Return:
        A 1d tensor with shape (m,), the outputs of SVM on the test set.
